# MecrispFORTH_LCD1602

Forth words for 4bit parallel connection to a LCD1602.

This was written on an STM32f103, but should run at least on any STM32 microcontroller.

This is written and tested for Mecrips-Stellaris Forth: http://mecrisp.sourceforge.net/

I used Jean-Claude Wippler's flib to simplify the hardware access. https://git.jeelabs.org/jcw/embello/src/branch/master/explore/1608-forth/flib/
